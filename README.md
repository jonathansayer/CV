## Jonathan Sayer

An ambitious masters graduate of experimental physics, looking for a career in software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular, among other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a junior developer in a company that will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Worked in a team to develop a mobile app which would learn a user's regular journey and suggest interesting locations to visit, close to the user's regular route.
- The app was developed using an Agile methodology, ensuring all team members paired and worked on all aspects of the code base. A project manger role was introduced to promote communication between pairs, organise standups and assist anyone who was blocked.
- Experience in using Github's multibranch system, analysing pull requests and dealing with merge errors.
- During team projects at Makers Academy, I learned when to take the lead, and when it is more beneficial for someone else to lead on a particular task. I believe I have learned to be a better leader by learning how to organise the team, breaking down the work that the team needs to do and ensuring effective communication within the team.
- During my time as Project Manager I insisted on frequent meetings resulting in more effective inter team communication. I also assigned pairs based on technologies people wanted to work and where certain skills were needed. I also found that compulsive breaks involving team bonding exercises, such as table tennis of visiting a local park together, improved team moral and encouraged more efficient work.

#### Self-Learning

I understand the importance of being able to continuously learn new skills, especially in the technology industry.  Before Makers Academy, I taught myself C++ programming. During Makers I was constantly learning new technologies such as Sinatra, Rails and SQL. During the Final project, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) I learned how to use the the Ionic framework to launch our app onto a mobile device. Most of my learning of programming has been self_taught, with the encouragement of Makers Academy, and I will continue to teach myself new skills in technology.

#### Test-driven Development

All code that I write is test-driven. I believe that test-driving code ensures, clean, bug free code which can be easily understood by another individual. Tests ensure that all aspects of the code work and reduces the risk of any code being written which may over-complicate the end product. I have been Test Driving code since the start of my Coding Career at Makers and have never looked back. From my first Project at Makers, the [airport challenge], to my last project, the [Todo List Challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) has been test driven.

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database

[Chitter](https://github.com/jonathansayer/Chitter_Redo) is a twitter clone which allows a user to sign in and peep (tweet). An understanding of database relationships was essential to complete this program. For the final Makers Academy Project,[Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic), we built a Rails API, in which the building of, I was heavily involved with.  

#### JavaScript

The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) and [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) were both using only Javascript. JQuery was used in the Bowling Scorecard challenge and Angular was used for the Todo List. JavaScript was difficult for me and required more time on my part to complete these challenges. I recognise Angular, particularly, as a very powerfull tool and I enjoyed working on both of these projects.

#### Blog Writing
Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/). This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

####Passion 
This may not be a skill but it is trait that I have developed over time and use to my advantage. I love building new products and working with new technologies. The most exciting time at Makers Academy for me was developing the [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) App for our final project. I loved learning about a new framework in the form of Ionic and I still enjoyed figuring out backend problems in a familar framework such as Rails. The Makers Academy experiance was 12 weeks of hard work and frustration while constantly meeting and overcoming obstacles. However, I have fallen in love with coding and I cannot imagine a career without coding.

## Experience

#### Close Brothers (July 2014)
Intern July 2014
Interned at Close Brothers Asset Management for the Research Team. Responsibilities included writing a research report on the chemical industry for the benefit of one of the researchers and preparing a thirty minute presentation for members of the investment analyst team, and several Portfolio Managers, which covered an overview on the chemical industry and the larger chemical companies as well as valuating some of the more interesting companies.

####Close Brothers Future Leaders (July 2014)                                               
The programme focused on developing skills such as teamwork, developing a business plan and presenting original ideas to large audiences. The programme brought together students from top universities, encouraged them to collaborate on original business ideas and work together to present these ideas to respected business leaders. As part of the course, I lead a team, which developed and presented an original fundraising idea to a charity, having only been given the brief of making the charity “bigger and better”. The course concluded with a gala dinner, where I, along with several members of the team, presented an original business plan to an audience of 150 people including four judges, who included Neil Davies, CEO of Leasing at Close Brothers, and Miles Jacobson, Founder of Sports Interactive.
