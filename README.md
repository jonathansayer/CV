## Jonathan Sayer

An ambitious masters graduate of experimental physics, looking for a career in software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular, among other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a junior developer in a company that will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Worked in a team to develop a mobile app which would learn a user's regular journey and suggest interesting locations to visit, close to the user's regular route.
- The app was developed using an Agile methodology, ensuring all team members paired and worked on all aspects of the code base. A project manger role was introduced to promote communication between pairs, organise standups and assist anyone who was blocked.
- Experience in using Github's multibranch system, analysing pull requests and dealing with merge errors.
- During team projects at Makers Academy, I learned when to take the lead, and when it is more beneficial for someone else to lead on a particular task. I believe I have learned to be a better leader by learning how to organise the team, breaking down the work that needs to be done and ensuring effective communication within the team.
- During my time as Project Manager I insisted on frequent meetings resulting in more effective inter team communication. I also assigned pairs based on technologies people wanted to work on and where certain skills were needed. I also found that compulsive breaks involving team bonding activities, such as table tennis or visiting a local park together, improved team moral and encouraged more efficient work.

#### Self-Learning

- I understand the importance of being able to continuously learn new skills, especially in the technology industry.  
- Self Taught in C++ programming.
- Constantly learning new technologies such as Sinatra, Rails and SQL during my time at Makers Academy.
- Most of my learning of programming has been self_taught, with the encouragement of Makers Academy.
- Learning new technologies is, for me, the most exciting aspects of working in the Tech industry.
- During the Final project, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic), I learned how to use the the Ionic framework to launch our app onto a mobile device.

#### Agile Coding Methodology

- Have a clear understanding of Agile Coding methodology.
- Adopting an Agile approach when coding allows the code to be easily read, altered and added to by others.
- The code should also be test driven to allow other developers to see what the code does and to allow other alterations to be made easily.
- Built the Detour app in two weeks with a team a five. The code was written using an Agile Methodology to achieve the most efficient code base possible and to ensure the features that each team pair worked on worked.

#### Test-driven Development

- All code that I write is test-driven.
- Test-driving code ensures, clean, bug free code which can be easily understood by another individual.
- Tests ensure that all aspects of the code work and reduces the risk of any code being written which may over-complicate the end product.
- I have been test driving code since the start of my coding career at Makers and have never looked back. From my first Project at Makers Academy, the [airport challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/airport_challenge), to my last project, the [Todo List Challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge), has been test driven.

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database

- Ruby is a fantastic language to learn as it's more "Human Readable" than most other computer languages. As a result this allows other developers to understand the code base quickly and easily.
- postgreSQL is simple database framework to use and is versitile in it's uses. A simple database can easily be set up or database relationships can be implemented for more complex problems.   
- [Chitter](https://github.com/jonathansayer/Chitter_Redo) is a twitter clone which allows a user to sign in and peep (tweet). The program is built using a Sinatra Framework and an understanding of database relationships was essential to complete this program.
- The [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) required a Rails API to be built. The API was paired with a postgreSQL database in order to store the coordinates.
- One of my current projects is to build a [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess) using rails. I chose to develop a chess game as it offers a challenge both in the backend logic and in the front end. Currently the Rails backend logic has been developed and I will be developing a front end using Javascript and Angular.   

#### JavaScript

- JavaScipt offers a the opportunity for a Developer to build a web application or App with a seamless User interface. Since JavaScipt runs in the browser there is no need to send bothersome HTTP requests to a server which slows down the whole User Experience.
- JavaScript can easily be paired with frameworks such a jQuery or Angular to add a bit more sparkle to any application.
- The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) was developed using JavaScript with some jQuery in there to spice up the front end.
- The [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) challenge was also developed in JavaScipt and used the Angular Framework to make the whole interface as seamless as possible.
- I love the flexibility with and diversity that comes with both frameworks and I recognise Angular, particularly, as a very powerfull tool and I enjoyed working on both of these projects very much.
- My next Javascript challenge is to build a front end to my [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess). Stay tuned.

#### Blog Writing
- Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/).
- This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

####Passion
- This may not be a skill but it is trait that I have developed over time and use to my advantage.
- I love building new products and working with new technologies.
- The most exciting time at Makers Academy for me was developing the [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) App for our final project.
- I loved learning about a new framework in the form of Ionic and I still enjoyed figuring out backend problems in a familiar framework such as
 Rails.
- The Makers Academy experience was 12 weeks of hard work and frustration while constantly meeting and overcoming obstacles. However, I have fallen in love with coding and I cannot imagine a career without it.
