- Conducted research on the Chemical industry and analysed corporate data for Close Brother Asset Management, which included reading past reports and obtaining information from members of the companies being researched.

#### Ruby using a PostgreSQL database
   
- Projects, such as the [Clothing Retailer](https://github.com/jonathansayer/clothing_retailer) challenge are written in Ruby, with a PostgreSQL database and tested using Rspec. 
- A current project, the [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess), has been built on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. 

#### JavaScript

- My next Javascript challenge is to build a front end to my [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess) using Angular. Stay tuned.

#### Blog Writing
- Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/).
- This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

#### Passion
