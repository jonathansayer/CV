## Jonathan Sayer

An ambitious masters graduate of experimental physics, looking for a career in software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular, among other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a junior developer in a company that will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Built a location-based mobile app in a scrum team of five people over two weeks.
- Pair-programming with my team ensured the code was written to a high standard.
- After we recognised we needed a project manager, I was elected, making our team more productive and improving morale during a tough two weeks.

#### Self-Learning

- Recognise the importance of continuously learning new skills in the tech industry.
- Learning new technologies is the most exciting part about working in tech.
- Self taught in Ruby, Javascript, Rails, Angular and C++.
- Learnt how to use the Ionic framework in order to launch final project at Makers Academy, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic).


#### Agile Coding Methodology

- Recognise Agile Coding as the most efficient and reliable way to build a product.
- Frequent communication  within a team and test driven code ensures an Agile code base. 
- All my code is test driven. From my first Project at Makers Academy, the [airport challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/airport_challenge), to my last project, the [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) Challenge, has been test driven and written using an Agile Methodology.

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database
   
- Projects, such as the [Clothing Retailer](https://github.com/jonathansayer/clothing_retailer) challenge have been written in Ruby, with a PostgreSQL database and tested using Rspec. 
- A current project, the [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess), is built on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. 

#### JavaScript

- The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) challenge and [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) challenge were written using the JQuery and Angular frameworks respectively.
- My next Javascript challenge is to build a front end to my [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess). Stay tuned.

#### Blog Writing
- Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/).
- This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

####Passion
- Building new products and working with new technologies gives a sense of uncomparable pride and satisfaction.
- The Makers Academy experience was 12 weeks of hard work and frustration while constantly meeting and overcoming obstacles. However, I have fallen in love with coding and I cannot imagine a career without it.
