## Jonathan Sayer

An ambitious masters graduate of experimental physics, looking for a career in software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular, among other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a junior developer in a company that will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Built a location-based mobile app in a scrum team of five people over two weeks.
- Pair-programming with my team ensured the code was written to a high standard.
- After we recognised we needed a project manager, I was elected, making our team more productive and improving morale during a tough two weeks.

#### Self-Learning

- Recognise the importance of continuously learning new skills in the tech industry.
- Learning new technologies is the most exciting part about working in tech.
- Self taught in Ruby, Javascript, Rails, Angular and C++.
- Learnt how to use the Ionic framework in order to launch final project and Makers Academy, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic)


#### Agile Coding Methodology

- Adopting an Agile approach when coding allows the code to be easily read, altered and added to by others.
- The code should also be test driven to allow other developers to see what the code does and to allow other alterations to be made easily, whilst ensuring the code the be bug free and written in it's simplest form.
- I have been test driving code since the start of my coding career at Makers and have never looked back. From my first Project at Makers Academy, the [airport challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/airport_challenge), to my last project, the [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) Challenge, has been test driven and written using the Agile Methodology.

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database
   
- Many of my projects, such as [Chitter](https://github.com/jonathansayer/Chitter_Redo) or [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) have been written using a Ruby framework pair with a PostgreSQL database and tested using the Rspec framework. 
- One of my current projects is to build a [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess) using rails. I chose to develop a chess game as it offers a challenge both in the backend logic and in the front end.

#### JavaScript

- The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) challenge and [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) challenge were written using the JQuery and Angular frameworks respectively. I love the flexibility with and diversity that comes with both frameworks and I recognise Angular, particularly, as a very powerful tool and I enjoyed working on both of these projects very much.
- My next Javascript challenge is to build a front end to my [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess). Stay tuned.

#### Blog Writing
- Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/).
- This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

####Passion
- This may not be a skill but it is trait that I have developed over time and use to my advantage.
- I love building new products and working with new technologies such as Ionic, as I did when developing the [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) App for our final Maker Academy Project.
- The Makers Academy experience was 12 weeks of hard work and frustration while constantly meeting and overcoming obstacles. However, I have fallen in love with coding and I cannot imagine a career without it.
