## Jonathan Sayer

An ambitious masters graduate of experimental physics, looking for a career in software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular, among other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a junior developer in a company that will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Worked in a team to develop a mobile app which would learn a user's regular journey and suggest interesting locations to visit, close to the user's regular route.
- The app was built using Agile methodology which involved frequent stand-up meetings, ensuring clear communication between pairs and frequently revisiting our user stories as a team to ensure the simplest possible code was being written. 
- Experience in using Github's multi-branch system, analysing pull requests and dealing with merge errors.
- Team Bonding activities such as table tennis or other games where essential to ensure team moral and encourage more efficient work.

#### Self-Learning

- I understand the importance of being able to continuously learn new skills, especially in the technology industry.
- Constantly learning new technologies such as Sinatra, Rails and SQL during my time at Makers Academy, I am also self taught in C++.
- Learning new technologies is, for me, the most exciting aspects of working in the Tech industry.
- During the Final project, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic), I learned how to use the the Ionic framework to launch our app onto a mobile device.

#### Agile Coding Methodology

- Adopting an Agile approach when coding allows the code to be easily read, altered and added to by others.
- The code should also be test driven to allow other developers to see what the code does and to allow other alterations to be made easily, whilst ensuring the code the be bug free and written in it's simplest form.
- I have been test driving code since the start of my coding career at Makers and have never looked back. From my first Project at Makers Academy, the [airport challenge](https://github.com/jonathansayer/airport_challenge), to my last project, the [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) Challenge, has been test driven and written using the Agile Methodology.

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database

- Ruby is a fantastic language to learn as it's more "Human Readable" than most other computer languages.
- PostgreSQL is simple database framework to use and is versatile in it's uses. A simple database can easily be set up or database relationships can be implemented for more complex problems.   
- Many of my project, such as [Chitter](https://github.com/jonathansayer/Chitter_Redo) or [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) have been written using a Ruby framework pair with a PostgreSql database. One of my current projects is to build a [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess) using rails. I chose to develop a chess game as it offers a challenge both in the backend logic and in the front end.

#### JavaScript

- JavaScipt offers a the opportunity for a Developer to build a web application or App with a seamless User interface. Since JavaScipt runs in the browser there is no need to send bothersome HTTP requests to a server which slows down the whole User Experience.
- JavaScript can easily be paired with frameworks such a jQuery or Angular to add a bit more sparkle to any application.
- The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) challenge and [Todo List](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) challenge were written using the Jquery and Angular frameworks respectively. I love the flexibility with and diversity that comes with both frameworks and I recognise Angular, particularly, as a very powerful tool and I enjoyed working on both of these projects very much.
- My next Javascript challenge is to build a front end to my [Chess Game](https://github.com/jonathansayer/chess). Stay tuned.

#### Blog Writing
- Everyday I was at Makers Academy, I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/).
- This helped me to consolidate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

####Passion
- This may not be a skill but it is trait that I have developed over time and use to my advantage.
- I love building new products and working with new technologies such as Ionic, as I did when developing the [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) App for our final Maker Academy Project.
- The Makers Academy experience was 12 weeks of hard work and frustration while constantly meeting and overcoming obstacles. However, I have fallen in love with coding and I cannot imagine a career without it.
